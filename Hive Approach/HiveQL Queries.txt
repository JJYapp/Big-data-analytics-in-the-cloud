# ============================== Hive Approach (HiveQL) ============================== #

# Please change the following pathways accordingly
# Copy and execute query one by one

# Query 1 #
CREATE TABLE IF NOT EXISTS staging_transactions (Datetime string, Bank string, Amount_Received decimal, Currency string, Format string)
ROW FORMAT DELIMITED
FIELDS TERMINATED BY ','
LINES TERMINATED BY '\n'; 

# Query 2 #
CREATE TABLE IF NOT EXISTS transactions (Datetime string, Bank string, Amount_Received decimal, Currency string, Format string)
ROW FORMAT DELIMITED
FIELDS TERMINATED BY ','
LINES TERMINATED BY '\n'; 

# Query 3 #
LOAD DATA LOCAL INPATH '{local path to dataset}' INTO TABLE staging_transactions; 

# Query 4 #
INSERT INTO TABLE transactions
SELECT * FROM staging_transactions WHERE Bank <> 'To Bank'; 

# Query 5 #
DROP TABLE IF EXISTS staging_transactions;

# Query 6 #
SELECT Bank, SUM(Amount_Received) AS `Total Amount`, COUNT(Amount_Received) AS `Number of Transactions`, AVG(Amount_Received) AS `Average Amount`
FROM transactions
GROUP BY Bank
LIMIT 10;
